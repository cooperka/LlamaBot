__FORCETOC__

'''LlamaBot''' is an [[IRC bot]], started by the [[Oak-Reep Programming Team]] (ORPT) for the [[Swiftirc|SwiftIRC]] channel [irc://irc.SwiftIRC.net/Final-Eternity #Final-Eternity] (LlamaBot is currently located at channel [irc://irc.SwiftIRC.net/LlamaBot #LlamaBot]).  LlamaBot is written in the [[mIRC scripting language]], also known as '''mSL''', and features an [[interface (computer science)|interface]] for all [[Scripting language|scripts]] that allows the user to customize the bot in a number of ways, including channel options, [[Color scheme|color schemes]], and default [[User (computing)|usernames]].

==History==

LlamaBot's original purpose was to provide [[Personal computer game|gaming]] stats (especially for [[Role-playing game|RPG's]]) in the SwiftIRC channel #Final-Eternity. In [[January 2007]], channel #Final-Eternity was deserted when its [[Internet Relay Chat channel operator|operator]] abandoned the channel. LlamaBot was then moved to its own channel, named #LlamaBot<ref>[irc://irc.SwiftIRC.net/LlamaBot LlamaBot at Channel #LlamaBot]</ref>, where it is currently stationed and used.  Since the departure from channel #Final-Eternity, the ORPT has expanded and modified LlamaBot's commands and functions in order to reach a slightly larger variety of users.

==Functions and Commands==

LlamaBot has numerous different scripts available, and a number of operators on-call.  LlamaBot has [[Command (computing)|commands]] that range from date and time [[Function (computer science)|functions]], to [[ASCII]] (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) help, to basic IRC help when asked a question.<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/llamabot/ LlamaBot Commands and Information]</ref>  The following is an incomplete list of LlamaBot's practical commands:

LlamaBot also offers several fun and gaming functions, including [[deathmatch (gaming)|deathmatch]] games, [[Guessing game|guessing games]], and humorous quotes.  Recently, a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[Multiplayer game|two-player]] [[chess]] game was added in the form of a [[graphical user interface]].  The chess game is still in its [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta version]] but updates are expected.  One LlamaBot user claimed that LlamaBot is one of few IRC bots that stresses humor and [[Video game|game-play]] along with practicality.  However, there are many other IRC bots, such as [[Eggdrop]] or [[Seeborg]], that also employ, or are entirely made for entertaining functions.  The following is an incomplete list of LlamaBot's fun and gaming commands:

LlamaBot commands are given in the customary IRC manner (usually beginning with a '!' or '@')<ref>[http://seerofsouls.com/wiki/SeerOfSouls/IrcBot Common IRC Bot Commands]</ref>.  Most commands are followed by a number or [[String (computer science)|string]].  For example, to find the weather in [[Chicago, Illinois]], the user enters <code>!weather Chicago</code>.  LlamaBot will then connect to a weather website, read the [[HTML]] [[source code]], and report the up-to-date weather on the [[Online chat|chat]].  Therefore, [[Infobot|InfoBots]], such as LlamaBot, are useful as [[calculator|calculators]], for [[Exchange rate|currency conversions]], word definitions, and other things which you would otherwise have to open a [[Website|site]] for.  Here is how LlamaBot might respond to the command <code><nowiki>!weather Chicago</nowiki></code>:
 <span style="color:blue"><+Username></span> !weather Chicago
 <span style="color:red"><@LlamaBot></span> Weather for <span style="color:green">Chicago, Illinois</span>:
 <span style="color:red"><@LlamaBot></span> Temperature: <span style="color:green">80.7 °F </span>(27.1 °C)
 <span style="color:red"><@LlamaBot></span> Condition: <span style="color:green">Partly Cloudy</span>

==Criticisms==
Since leaving channel #Final-Eternity, users have complained of the slow speed at which LlamaBot is updated.  The beta version chess game, released on [[July 3|July 3rd]], has still not been updated to allow undoing moves and recognizing forced [[Draw (chess)|draws]].  The ORPT claimed updates to the chess game would be released shortly.  Additionally, LlamaBot does not offer [[Internet Protocol version 6|IPv6]] or [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|classless inter-domain routing]] support, while other bots, such as [[Psotnic]], do.

==Support==
LlamaBot is hosted and maintained in the [[Swiftirc|SwiftIRC]] channel #LlamaBot by the Oak-Reep Programming Team.  The complete list of commands can be found at the [http://www.freewebs.com/llamabot/ LlamaBot home page].  It is to be noted that the name 'LlamaBot' was also used as the nicknames of the [[Eggdrop]] bot [[Software versioning|versions]] 1.6.16 through 1.6.18, but the two are not related.<ref>[http://uptime.eggheads.org/?botnick=LlamaBot LlamaBot Eggdrop Versions]</ref>
