## LLAMABOT - THE IRC BOT

LlamaBot is extremely useful for not only your RuneScape needs, but also for various other fun and useful activities (see below).  The LlamaBot staff is dedicated to providing enjoyable entertainment for everyone, not just the RuneScape community.  Not only are most of the RuneScape-related commands included in LlamaBot's vast vocabulary, but many other commands are as well.

LlamaBot is currently hosted only on the SwiftIRC networks.
In order to invite LlamaBot to your channel, type: /invite LlamaBot #YourChannel

All of the commands are listed below.
An "!" signifies a private message, and an "@" signifies a public message, if there are two options.
Any underlined text means that you should replace that section with something else.
