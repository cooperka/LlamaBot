## RECENT NEWS

3-09-2016
LlamaBot is now open-source! Check out the code on GitHub [here](https://github.com/cooperka/LlamaBot).

2-07-2009
Two new tabs were added to the website: IRC and Java DM. IRC uses a program called PJIRC to quickly and easily connect to the #LlamaBot channel, as well as supporting many IRC commands. The Java DM is similar to the DM LlamaBot uses, but it is hosted on this website instead of using LlamaBot and allows for lag-less multiplayer fighting.

1-13-2009
There is now a [!@]wiki (User) command. See the main page for more information.

12-05-2008
Some new "of the day"s have been added, including !wotd (word of the day), !qotd (quote of the day), and !motd (motivation of the day). More similar content will be added soon. Also, there are 3 dictionaries now instead of just one - !define, !define2, and !urban.

11-26-2008
I have moved the DM commands from the main page to their own, separate page on the site. A few more commands were added and perfected, and all commands are now explained in more detail.

11-24-2008
Several new commands were added, including multiple DM updates as follows: You may now challenge one person to a duel (instead of having it open to the whole channel); You may now use !inventory to see what items you have; There is a new item in the store, the Power Potion; The accepted DM commands (!whip, !dds, etc.) now include more generic attacks so people who do not play RuneScape can use it more easily - of course, all previous accepted commands are still accepted. For more detailed information about the commands, see the main page.

11-19-2008
The website has been updated significantly, and is now more understandable and complete.

11-09-2008
LlamaBot has a new feature! LlamaBot will now offer helpful advice when questions are asked about basic IRC functions. For example, if someone were to ask, "How do I change my username?" LlamaBot would reply, "To change your username, type: /nick NewName"

11-02-2008
LlamaBot now fully supports the use of custom color settings (!c1, !c2, and !c3 - see "Miscellaneous Commands")

10-18-2008
Most of the RuneScape commands are now working again after the major site change that Jagex went through (sorry for the delay).

08-19-2008
LlamaBot is now on Wikipedia! Check out the page [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LlamaBot).
