## IRC SOLDAT COMMANDS

The following commands only work in #LlamaBot, and you must be at least a Half-Operator (orange colored with a % sign) to use them.  Most commands have a shorter version you can use; the whole command will be spelled out, with the necessary letters in bold.

If you do not already have them, extra maps that I have made are available at
http://llamabot.webs.com/maps.rar and can be unpacked using WinRAR, which you can download from
